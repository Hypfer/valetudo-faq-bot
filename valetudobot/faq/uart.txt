Most of the time you might want to connect to a bot's serial console using UART.
If that is the case, you need a UART to USB converter supporting 3.3V; check https://www.google.com/search?q=usb+to+uart+3.3+v+converter - for example https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJ3ZQM4
Now keep these things in mind

1. Always set the adapter to 3.3V (unless your bot requires 5V, which are none these days). A too high voltage might kill your robot.
2. For our vacuum robots, <b>never</b> connect the voltage (labeld V+, 3V3 or 5V) pin; this might damage your robot or PC!
3. Connect only GND, RX and TX
4. Normally TX (transmit) on one side goes to RX (receive) on the other
5. Sometimes a manufacturer mislabels RX and TX; so if you see nothing on your serial monitor, swap RX and TX.
6. It is usually safe to swap RX and TX. So if your USB adapter is mislabeled, that's no problem :)
