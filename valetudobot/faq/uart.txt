Most of the time you might want to connect to a bot's serial console using UART.
If that is the case, you need a UART to USB converter supporting 3.3V; check https://www.google.com/search?q=usb+to+uart+3.3+v+converter - for example https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJ3ZQM4
Now keep these things in mind
<ol>
<li>Always set the adapter to 3.3V (unless your bot requires 5V, which are none these days). A too high voltage might kill your robot.</li>
<li>For our vacuum robots, <b>never</b> connect the voltage (labeld V+, 3V3 or 5V) pin; this might damage your robot or PC!</li>
<li>Connect only GND, RX and TX</li>
<li>Normally TX (transmit) on one side goes to RX (receive) on the other</li>
<li>Sometimes a manufacturer mislabels RX and TX; so if you see nothing on your serial monitor, swap RX and TX.</li>
<li>It is usually safe to swap RX and TX.</li>
</ul>
